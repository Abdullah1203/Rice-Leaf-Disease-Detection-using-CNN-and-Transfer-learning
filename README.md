# Rice Leaf Disease Detection Using CNN
# Transfer Learning
# Google Collab

This is a reasearch project on Rice leaf Disease detection. The purpose of this project is to detect the rice leaf disese to help farmers in Bangladesh. 
Due to covid issue we could not get leaf dataset from BARC so that we can apply reasearch on Bangladeshi data. We took online dataset to complete the project.

Dataset was taken from Kaggle.
